Hello, fellow developers! 👋

Welcome to my repository, where you'll find a vast collection of projects that I have been passionately developing and maintaining over the past 20 years. With over 6.5 million downloads on NuGet and a growing community of over 500 stargazers on GitHub, I am dedicated to creating and providing high-quality tools and resources for the community.

I am a seasoned solution architect, mentor, trainer, and full-stack developer with a rich professional experience under my belt. I am currently employed at Wangkanai Sugar, where I specialize in building enterprise applications and teaching .NET, Blazor, and Azure. I am always up for a challenge, and I take pride in transforming simple proposals into robust, well-defined, and thoroughly tested solutions.
